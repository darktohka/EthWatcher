# EthWatcher

EthWatcher is a Python daemon, written in order to keep EthMiner (or alternatively other kind of cryptocurrency miner) instances alive and healthy on Windows.

In addition to this, it also provides users the ability to use a hotkey to check their NiceHash (or other miner pool) progress page.
